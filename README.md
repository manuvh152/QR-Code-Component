## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Since this is my first challenge, I think what I have learned the most is to detect the properties needed in CSS to give a certain look to a component.


### Continued development

I want to to keep learning some properties of CSS that I'm not used to yet.
